      <p><strong class="text-info">Creecolo</strong> stands for "Create Ecolo". It is a social network where you can share your ecological creation with others.</p>
      <p>The idea comes from an observation : we all have a lot of objects that we don't use anymore, but are still in good condition. So why not give them a second life ?</p>
      <p>By reusing your objects, you accomplish several things:</p>
      <p>&#8227; You save money, no need to buy something you can do by yourself !</p>
      <p>&#8227; You help the planet by recycling your old objects</p>
      <p>&#8227; You avoid overconsumption</p>
